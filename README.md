# Electricity_Price_and_Consumption_Prediction


## **Description:**

* **Electricity consumption and price prediction is the process of using mathematical models to predict what electricity, price consumption will be in the future. This can be a difficult task, as electricity consumption, price are affected by a number of factors, including:**

* **Supply and demand:** The price of electricity is determined by the supply and demand for electricity. When demand is high and supply is low, prices will be high. When demand is low and supply is high, prices will be low.
* **Weather:** The weather can have a significant impact on electricity prices. For example, hot weather can increase demand for air conditioning, which can lead to higher electricity prices.
* **Economic conditions:** The economy can also have an impact on electricity prices. For example, during a recession, demand for electricity may decline, which can lead to lower prices.
* **Government policies:** Government policies can also affect electricity prices. For example, government subsidies for renewable energy can lead to lower electricity prices.

* There are a number of different methods that can be used to predict electricity prices. Some of the most common methods include:

* **Statistical methods:** Statistical methods use historical data to predict future prices. These methods can be relatively simple to use, but they may not be very accurate for predicting prices in the long term.
* **Machine learning methods:** Machine learning methods use artificial intelligence to learn from historical data and predict future prices. These methods can be more accurate than statistical methods, but they can also be more complex to use.
* **Hybrid methods:** Hybrid methods combine statistical methods and machine learning methods to improve the accuracy of predictions.

# Time Series


* **Electricity price prediction is the process of forecasting future electricity prices. This can be done using a variety of methods, including time series analysis. Time series analysis is a statistical technique that uses historical data to predict future trends.**

There are many different time series models that can be used for electricity price prediction. Some of the most common models include:

* **Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models:** ARMA models are univariate models, which means that they only consider one variable, in this case electricity price. ARMA models are relatively simple to understand and implement, but they can be less accurate than other models.
Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models: ARIMA models are a generalization of ARMA models. ARIMA models can be used to forecast data that has trends, seasonality, and/or noise. ARIMA models are more accurate than ARMA models, but they can be more difficult to understand and implement.

* **Vector autoregressive (VAR) models:** VAR models are multivariate models, which means that they can consider multiple variables, such as electricity price, weather, and economic activity. VAR models are more accurate than ARMA and ARIMA models, but they can be more difficult to understand and implement.

* **The best time series model for electricity price prediction depends on the specific data set and the desired accuracy. In general, ARMA and ARIMA models are a good choice for simple data sets with limited trends and seasonality. VAR models are a good choice for more complex data sets with trends, seasonality, and/or noise.**

* Here Two DataSets is Given one is Production and another is Price Datasets

# DataSets Productrion Summary

* **The Year, Month, Day, and Hour columns are all categorical variables. The Electricity Production (GWh) column is a numerical variable.**

Here is a brief explanation of each feature:

* **Year:** The year in which the electricity production was recorded.
* **Month:** The month in which the electricity production was recorded.
* **Day:** The day of the month in which the electricity production was recorded.
* **Hour:** The hour of the day in which the electricity production was recorded.
* **Electricity Production (GWh):** The amount of electricity produced in gigawatt-hours (GWh) on the given day and hour.


# Datasets Price Summary

* **The dataset you provided is a CSV file containing data on electricity prices in the United States. It contains data for the years 2010 to 2020, and includes the following features:**

* **Date:** The date of the price measurement.
* **Hour:** The hour of the day at which the price was measured.
* **Price:** The price of electricity in dollars per kilowatt-hour.
* **Region:** The region of the United States in which the price was measured.
* **Source:** The source of the data.
